#include <iostream> // here include is used as a preprocessor directive and iostream is a header file used for taking inputs and outputs
using namespace std;// If you dont want to use std again and again with cout so you can write like this 
int main () // int main in a function where the excecution of code begins (mandatory in any program)
{ // it declares the start and the end of the function
    cout<<"Hello world"<<endl;
    return 0;
